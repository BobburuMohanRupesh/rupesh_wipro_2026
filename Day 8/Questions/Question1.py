# Write a Python program that:
#
# 1.Uses the requests library to send a GET request to a public REST API(e.g., users or posts API)
#
# 2. Sends custom headers with the request
#
# 3. Parses the JSON response and extracts specific fields
#
# 4. Serializes the extracted data and saves it into a JSON file
#
# 5. Handles HTTP errors using proper exception handling
#
